# Avro Simple

[Apache Avro™ ](https://avro.apache.org/) support for Haskell.

Apache Avro™ is a leading serialisation format for record data,
with a powerful type system, and great support for schema evolution.

This library offers comprehensive support for reading and writing
Avro binary data to Haskell types, through the definition of
Codecs. These describe Avro Schemas, as well
as encoders and decoders for Avro values.

This project is a direct port of our Elm Avro library. As such, it
is not fancy.

But it is:

- Efficient,
- Correct, and
- Easy to use.
